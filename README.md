**How It Works:**
- The admin uploads a candidate's photo and name.
- The candidate tells their story (the three statements) live or via another channel.

- **Port conflicts:** The app runs on port `1992` by default. Change in `server.js` if needed.
- **API errors:** Ensure the server is running and accessible at the correct port.
